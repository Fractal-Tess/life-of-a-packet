# The Transport Realm

Welcome back, protocol explorer! üè∞

Our packet has navigated routers and crossed networks, but now it needs to ensure it arrives safely and in the right order. Enter the transport layer protocols - the guardians of reliable delivery.

In this chapter, we'll explore:

- The difference between TCP and UDP
- Ports and sockets
- The three-way handshake
- Error checking and reliability

<SingleQuestion
  client:load
  label="Which protocol provides reliable, ordered delivery of data?"
  choices={['TCP', 'UDP', 'Both TCP and UDP', 'Neither TCP nor UDP']}
  correct={0}
  explanation="TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery of data."
/>
<Spliter />

## TCP: The Reliable Courier

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is like a meticulous courier service. It ensures that:

<Spliter />

- All packets arrive in order
- No packets are lost
- Data is delivered error-free

Key features of TCP:

<Spliter />

- Connection-oriented
- Three-way handshake
- Error checking
- Flow control

<MultipleQuestion
  label="Which of the following are features of TCP?"
  choices={[
    'Connection-oriented',
    'Three-way handshake',
    'Error checking',
    'Connectionless',
  ]}
  correct={[0, 1, 2]}
  explanation="TCP is connection-oriented, uses a three-way handshake, and provides error checking. It is not connectionless."
/>
<Spliter />

## UDP: The Speedy Messenger

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is like a speedy messenger. It's:

<Spliter />

- Connectionless
- Faster but less reliable
- Ideal for real-time applications

Common uses of UDP:

<Spliter />

- Video streaming
- Online gaming
- Voice over IP (VoIP)
- DNS queries

<OpenQuestion
  label="Which protocol is often used for video streaming and why? (Short answer)"
  correct="UDP"
  explanation="UDP is often used for video streaming because it prioritizes speed over reliability and can tolerate some packet loss."
/>
<Spliter />

## Ports and Sockets: The Network Addresses

Ports and sockets are like apartment numbers in a building:

<Spliter />

- Ports identify specific services (e.g., HTTP on port 80)
- Sockets combine IP address and port number
- Well-known ports are standardized (0-1023)

<SingleQuestion
  client:load
  label="What is the well-known port number for HTTPS?"
  choices={['80', '443', '8080', '21']}
  correct={1}
  explanation="HTTPS typically uses port 443, while HTTP uses port 80."
/>
<Spliter />

## Next Steps in Our Journey

Now that our packet is safely delivered, in the next chapter we'll explore the guardians of network security. We'll learn about:

- Firewalls and their operation
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Stateful vs stateless inspection
- Common network threats

Until then, keep your connections secure! Remember, every protocol has its purpose.
