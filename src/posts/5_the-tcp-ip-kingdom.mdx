# The Transport Realm

Welcome back, protocol explorer! üè∞

Our packet has navigated routers and crossed networks, but now it needs to ensure it arrives safely and in the right order. Enter the transport layer protocols - the guardians of reliable delivery.

In this chapter, we'll explore:
- The difference between TCP and UDP
- Ports and sockets
- The three-way handshake
- Error checking and reliability

<SingleQuestion
  client:load
  label="Which protocol provides reliable, ordered delivery of data?"
  choices={[
    'TCP',
    'UDP',
    'Both TCP and UDP',
    'Neither TCP nor UDP',
  ]}
/>
<Spliter />

## TCP: The Reliable Courier

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is like a meticulous courier service. It ensures that:
- All packets arrive in order
- No packets are lost
- Data is delivered error-free

Key features of TCP:
- Connection-oriented
- Three-way handshake
- Error checking
- Flow control

<SingleQuestion
  client:load
  label="What is the purpose of the TCP three-way handshake?"
  choices={[
    'To encrypt the data',
    'To establish a connection',
    'To compress the data',
    'To authenticate the user',
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="The TCP three-way handshake is used to establish a reliable connection between two devices before data transfer begins."

## UDP: The Speedy Messenger

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is like a speedy messenger. It's:
- Connectionless
- Faster but less reliable
- Ideal for real-time applications

Common uses of UDP:
- Video streaming
- Online gaming
- Voice over IP (VoIP)
- DNS queries

<SingleQuestion
  client:load
  label="Which of these applications would most likely use UDP?"
  choices={[
    'File transfer',
    'Online banking',
    'Video streaming',
    'Email',
  ]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Video streaming often uses UDP because it prioritizes speed over reliability, and can tolerate some packet loss."

## Ports and Sockets: The Network Addresses

Ports and sockets are like apartment numbers in a building:
- Ports identify specific services (e.g., HTTP on port 80)
- Sockets combine IP address and port number
- Well-known ports are standardized (0-1023)

<SingleQuestion
  client:load
  label="What is the well-known port number for HTTPS?"
  choices={[
    '80',
    '443',
    '8080',
    '21',
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="HTTPS typically uses port 443, while HTTP uses port 80."

## Next Steps in Our Journey

Now that our packet is safely delivered, in the next chapter we'll explore the guardians of network security. We'll learn about:
- Firewalls and their operation
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Stateful vs stateless inspection
- Common network threats

Until then, keep your connections secure! Remember, every protocol has its purpose.
