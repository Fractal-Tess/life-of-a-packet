# The Network of Tomorrow

Welcome back, future explorer! ðŸš€

Our packet has traveled through the present-day network, but now it's time to look ahead. The future of networking is full of exciting technologies that will change how we connect and communicate.

In this chapter, we'll explore:
- Software Defined Networking (SDN)
- Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
- The evolution of 5G and beyond
- Network automation and AI

<SingleQuestion
  client:load
  label="What is the primary benefit of Software Defined Networking (SDN)?"
  choices={[
    'Increased network speed',
    'Centralized network control and programmability',
    'Better wireless coverage',
    'Improved hardware performance',
  ]}
/>

## Software Defined Networking: The Programmable Network

SDN is like giving the network a brain:

- Separates control plane from data plane
- Centralized network management
- Programmable through APIs
- Enables network automation

<SingleQuestion
  client:load
  label="Which plane does SDN separate from the data plane?"
  choices={[
    'Management plane',
    'Control plane',
    'Application plane',
    'Security plane',
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="SDN separates the control plane from the data plane, allowing for centralized network management."

## Network Function Virtualization: The Virtual Network

NFV is like turning hardware into software:

- Virtualizes network functions (firewalls, routers, etc.)
- Runs on standard servers
- Increases flexibility and scalability
- Reduces hardware costs

## 5G and Beyond: The Wireless Future

The evolution of mobile networks continues:

- 5G offers higher speeds and lower latency
- Network slicing for different use cases
- Integration with IoT devices
- Research into 6G already underway

<SingleQuestion
  client:load
  label="What is network slicing in 5G?"
  choices={[
    'Dividing the network into physical segments',
    'Creating virtual networks for different use cases',
    'Splitting data packets into smaller pieces',
    'Separating wireless frequencies',
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="Network slicing in 5G involves creating virtual networks tailored for specific use cases or services."
