# The Beginning

Hey there, brave explorer! ðŸ‘‹

<Spliter />

Ever wondered what _really_ happens when you browse the web? When you click a link
or type a web address and hit Enter? It seems instant, right? Magic? Almost! But
it's actually the start of an epic quest undertaken by a lot tiny adventurers: **data
packets**.

<Spliter />

In the series **The life of a packet** you will journey with me on a quest. We'll follow a brave little packet from its creation on your computer, through the treacherous wilds of the internet, to its destination server and back again. Think of it like a digital odyssey, a game level packed with challenges, gatekeepers, and secret codes.

<Spliter />

Our goal? To unravel the mysteries of the internet, understand the protocols that
govern it, and maybe even learn some cool tech details along the way. Can't wait?
**Let's go!**

<Spliter />

## Level 1: Character Creation & Getting the Map

Our quest begins the moment you perform the sacred ritual: **The Clickâ„¢** (or **The Type-and-Enterâ„¢**).

You've just told your browser, "Hero! I need the treasure hidden at `google.com`!"

Your browser, the faithful quest-giver, understands. Its first thought isn't about sending data yet; it's about _where_ to send it. `google.com` is a human-friendly name, like calling a castle "Dragon's Keep."

<Spliter />

Computers, however, prefer precise coordinates â€“ **IP Addresses**. Think of them as precise coordinates on our digital map.

<Spliter />
You've seen these coordinates before... right? I mean, you must have, but in case
you haven't, they look something like this:

- 142.251.141.46
- 81.161.240.3

<Spliter />

This is called an **IPv4** address. They are basically a 4 numbers between 0 and 255 separated by dots.

There is another version called **IPv6** which is a 8 numbers between 0 and ffff separated by colons, but we won't need to worry about that in this quest.

<Spliter />

So why do computers need these coordinates?

Think of IP addresses like unique identification numbers in a massive digital library system:

Just as every book needs a unique catalog number to be found in a vast library,
every device on the internet needs a precise numerical address (IP address) to receive data.

These addresses don't represent physical locations - they're purely logical identifiers
that help routers determine how to forward data through the network, like how a library's
organization system helps locate books regardless of which shelf they're actually on.

<Spliter />
The library analogy helps understand the concept, but let's be more precise: The
internet is essentially one giant interconnected network where devices are identified
by their IP addresses. These addresses are logical identifiers that exist independently
of any physical location - a device could move across the world and keep the same
IP address as long as it stays on the same network.

<Spliter />

    'To track geographical locations',
    'To uniquely identify a device on a network',
    'To encrypt data packets',
    'To assign domain names',
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="An IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network, allowing data to be routed to the correct destination."

<Spliter />

## Ok, so the first challenge is **translation**. How do we turn the castle's _name_ into its _location_ on the map?

## Consulting the Oracle: The Domain Name System **(DNS)**

<Spliter />

Just as our hero needs a map to find the treasure, your computer needs to translate the castle's name (`google.com`) into its secret coordinates (IP address). But how does it do this? By consulting the internet's wise oracle: **DNS**!

Let's follow the steps of this magical consultation, RPG-style:

<Spliter />

### Step 1: Check the Backpack (Browser Cache)

Before setting out, the browser rummages through its backpack. Has it visited this castle before? If yes, it already has the map!

- _Quest Log: Found the map locally! Skip to destination._

<Spliter />

### Step 2: Ask the Local Guide (OS Cache/Stub Resolver)

If the backpack is empty, the browser turns to the local guideâ€”your Operating System. Maybe the OS remembers the way from a previous adventure.

- _Quest Log: Local guide knew the way! Skip to destination._

<Spliter />

### Step 3: Visit the Town Oracle (Recursive Resolver)

Still lost? Time to visit the town oracleâ€”a special DNS server (often run by your ISP or a public one like Google or Cloudflare). The OS asks: "Can you find the coordinates for this castle?" The oracle promises not to return until it has the answer (or knows it doesn't exist).

<Spliter />

Now, the oracle embarks on its own quest:

<Spliter />

#### 3.1: Query the High Council (Root Servers)

The oracle approaches the High Councilâ€”the Root Servers. "Where can I find the sages of the `.com` kingdom?" The council doesn't know the exact answer, but points the way to the `.com` sages (TLD servers).

<Spliter />

#### 3.2: Consult the Regional Sage (TLD Servers)

Next, the oracle visits the `.com` sage. "Who knows about `epic-example-quest.com`?" The sage directs the oracle to the Mapmaker Guildâ€”the Authoritative Nameservers for that domain.

<Spliter />

#### 3.3: Get the Final Directions (Authoritative Nameservers)

Finally, the oracle finds the Mapmaker Guild. "What are the coordinates for `google.com`?" The guild reveals the secret: the IP address!

<Spliter />

### Step 4: Return with the Map

The oracle rushes back, passing the coordinates to your OS, which hands them to the browser. Now, our hero has the map and can continue the quest!

_Surprisingly, this whole adventure usually takes just milliseconds!_
